Flight Manager for Reusable Stages [FMRS] v0.1.01
=================================================


Description
===========

	FMRS lets you actually fly back your launch stages.
	Fly them back to the launch site or just let them come down on parachutes.
	After landing or splash down, switch back to your main vessel and continue your mission without losing your boosters.
	If you want to do your launches SpaceX's Falcon 9 style, this is your plugin!

	FMRS supports the Blizzy78 Toolbar Plugin.


Instruction
============

	Attach probe cores to your stages which you would like to bring back.
	Go to the launch pad and arm FMRS.
	Launch you mission as usual.
	Every separated stage which is controllable will be listed in the window of the plugin.
	After reaching orbit you can switch back to the stage separations and control now your reusable stages.
	Bring them back down to Kerbin.
	After that switch back to your main mission or to other Stages.
	When all your stages are landed close the FMRS window and continue your mission.


Installation
============

	Copy the FMRS Folder into the GameData Folder of you KSP install.


Know issues
============

	Recovering your Stages immediately after landing is currently not as stable as it should be.
	I recommend to do all the landings and then switch back to the main mission.
	Close the plugin and after that go to the tracking station and recover your launch vehicles.
